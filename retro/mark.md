# Mark Arneman - Retrospective Notes

## 1) What went well

I am amazed with how well the team worked together, we were able to brainstorm ideas and combine concepts to create what we produced. Our initial prototype was created within the first hour of the jam and it rapidly evolved from there.

## 2) What didn't go well

There were some issues we faced close to crunch, the audio system would break, a plethora of physics and trigger bugs, our nested prefabs were not inheriting the changes made to the parent or child prefabs.

## 3) What lessons can we take moving forward

Have more testers/feedback early. We didn't document our design ideas. In the future we could create a GameJam template for Unity.

## 4) What was your personal favorite part of the jam

That every time I went to work on the project I had changes to pull. Seeing the game change and develop so rapidly really inspired me to continue working. I personally learned a lot during this jam, it was my first time working with [Asset Forge](http://assetforge.io/), as well as Unity's Animation, Pathfinding, and Physics systems.

## 5) What is your favorite thing in the game

We really nailed the aesthetic and mood of our game while packing in features. Two boss fights, varied paths, and a NewGame+ hard mode. I'm thrilled to see such a positive reception online.
