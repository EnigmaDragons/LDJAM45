Silas Reinagel - Retrospective Notes

## 1) What went well?

- The game looks beautiful and is genuinely fun to play!
- Team worked together incredibly well! Everyone was able to autonomously make strong contributions to the game with minimal direction.
- We built some really cool stuff in Unity. I was very happy with the composable world, the great flavor and the sweet combat system.

## 2) What didn't go well?

- The Game Jam Template wasn't designed as a maintainable solution, especially due to its use of DontDestroyOnLoad, and its fragile numeric indexing
- We didn't end up with sound effects for everything that needed it
- Several developers ran into frustrations with various aspects of the system (GameEvents, PreFab composition, Sound/Music integration)

## 3) What lessons can we take moving forward?

- Establish and document some guidelines around PreFab design rules
- Pre-build or find a nice sound/music system
- Don't invite sick people over to my house during a game jam, even if I think I've already had that strain

## 4) What was your personal favorite part of the jam?

- Fighting the Roomba boss for the first time

## 5) What is your favorite thing in the game?

- Intro Cutscene
- CatHouse nap time
- Roomba Boss fight
- Sweet music
- Insanely cute Cat character
