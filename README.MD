### Hackathon Objectives

----

- Have fun!
- Learn new things
- Deliver a simple, but fun experience

----

### Project Guidelines

----

- All work must happen against Github tickets.
- All active tickets must have a Role label.
- To begin work on a ticket, ensure that the ticket is assigned to you and is moved to the “In Progress” column.
- Only work on 1, or at most 2, ticket(s) at a time.
- If you wish to work on a ticket outside your role consult the Architect or Project Manager first
- If a ticket is taking a lot more work than you expected, reach out to the group
- Every ticket that is finished should result in a Git commit with the new assets
- Any team member may create a ticket for work they think is needed
- You may push directly to `master` or open a PR and merge, if you prefer

----

### Unity Guidance

----

- Use ScriptableObjects to store all game state
- Each person should have one personal folder in the project
- Do not touch or modify contents in anyone else's personal folder
- Save all of your GameObjects as PreFabs, so that we can quickly compose scenes with the desired elements
- For any Main Game Scene, only one person may be working on it at a time.
- Announce in the Discord channel when you start and stop work on a Main Game Scene
